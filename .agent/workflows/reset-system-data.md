# How to Reset System Data

If you want to clear all data (including demo appraisals) and start fresh:

1. Log in as **Super Admin** (`admin@agrop.co`).
2. Navigate to **System Admin** from the sidebar.
3. Scroll down to the **Danger Zone**.
4. Click the **Reset System Data** button.
5. Confirm the action in the browser prompt.

**Result:**
- All local storage data will be cleared.
- The page will reload.
- The system will revert to the initial state (default users only, no appraisals).
